DXL Streaming Documentation
===========================

The DXL Streaming Platform is a solution intended for groups (and maybe others) needing a
highly scalable, reliable and low latency solution to satisfy real-time messaging and stream processing
needs to organise and manage massive amounts of data, making it easily accessible in a unified
messaging platform thatâ€™s always readily available for many uses throughout the entire organization.

This messaging platform is intended to serve three primary uses:

**1. Messaging:** The messaging platform routes messages between any application, end point, or other
device connected to any micro-PoP, PoP, or Data Center.

**2. Data Integration:** The messaging platform captures streams of events or data changes and feeds these
to other data systems such as relational databases, key-value stores, Hadoop, or the data warehouse.

**3. Stream processing:** It enables continuous, real-time processing and transformation of these streams
and makes the results available system-wide.
